# DS-case-study
Data Science case study for my University studies where I was trying to model the length of stay of hospital patients.

Feel free to read my report which answers the guided questions.

The R code is provided as well.

I scored 80% on this assignment.

Note that the datasets of city A and B are adjusted datasets from 2 New Zealand hospitals (names anonymous)
